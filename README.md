## Pre-launch page

Here we code a basic pre-lauch page. This page just has one simple funtionality: when you try to put your email to recieve more information about the product, we validate the email that you write. You should recieve some feedback from the page:

- If the Email address field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email".
- But, if the email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! That doesnâ€™t look like an email address".

### Why we use React

We know that this site has a limited funtionallity and we would have been able to use vanilla JS and some html preprocesor(like pug). But we use React, because we think about reusability and scalabilty. If anybody wants grow this project up, it will be easer for them.

### About projects and styles

This projects was done following the requirements of FrontEnd mentor challenges. We mustn't share any material, like design systems files. Instead, feel free to change colours or take it from `_variables.scss` file.

You can see a deployed version of this page [here](https://pre-launch-page.netlify.app/).
